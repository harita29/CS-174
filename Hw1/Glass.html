<p>Polymer LGPs lack the dimensional stability required for ultra-slim displays. When a polymer LGP is subjected to heat and humidity, the material can warp and expand, compromising its opto-mechanical performance. The instability of polymer requires designers to add a wider bezel and thicker backlight with air gaps to compensate for this movement. Replacing polymer with glass solves this problem, but standard glass compositions have not met the optical requirements, until now.

Color purity is another key requirement of an LGP.  A combination of Corning’s proprietary fusion process and Iris™ Glass’ composition positions Corning’s light-guide plate offering to achieve color shift performance that matches the best-in-class material. 

Corning Iris™ Glass offers outstanding dimensional stability while ensuring superior optical performance that enables manufacturers to offer thinner TVs.</p>
